# Сrytposystem McEliece

## Information

The ***McEliece cryptosystem*** is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that allows you to work with linear (***n***, ***k***) codes that correct ***t*** errors.

In this work, the message is divided into 4 bits (those *k=4*), then encrypted, and a new 7-bit (those *n=7*) message is obtained. The message is sent over the pipe and 
an error is randomly added. On the opposite side, the algorithm is decrypted. 

P.S. More details - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEliece_cryptosystem)

## Run

* Set requirements.
* To start the program, you need to run **"McElise_UI.py"**.
* For encryption, in the window that appears, go to the "encrypt" tab. Click on the button and select the file.
* To decrypt a file, just go to the "decrypt" tab and click on the button.

#### *Notes:* 

1. You can encrypt any file (text, photo, document, etc.)
2. If the file is larger than 20kb, you will have to wait. Not touch window.
