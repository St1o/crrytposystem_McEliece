# Сrytposystem McEliece

##Information##
The ***McEliece cryptosystem*** is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that allows you to work with linear (*n*, *k*) codes that correct *t* errors.
In this work, the message is divided into 4 bits, then encrypted, and a new 7-bit message is obtained. The message is sent over the pipe and 
an error is randomly added. On the opposite side, the algorithm is decrypted. More details - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEliece_cryptosystem)

##Run##
*Set requirements.
*To start the program, you need to run **"McElise_UI.py"**.
*To decrypt a file, just go to the "decrypt" tab and click on the button.

*Notes:* 

1. You can encrypt any file (photo, document, etc.)
2. If the file is larger than 20kb, you will have to wait. Not touch window.
